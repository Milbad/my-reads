# MyReads: A Book Tracking App

## Project Overview
In the MyReads project, I created a bookshelf app that allows you to select and categorize books you have read, are currently reading, or want to read.
This is the project for the final assessment project for Udacity's React Fundamentals course, developed by [React Training](https://reacttraining.com). For this project, I used a starter template provided by Udacity. The goal of this template was to save us time by providing a static example of the CSS and HTML markup that may be used, but without any of the React code that is needed to complete the project.


## How to run the application
- Download the repository in your desktop and unzip it
- Open your terminal and run `yarn` and `yarn start`

## Backend Server

To simplify our development process, Udacity provided a backend server for us to develop against. The provided file [`BooksAPI.js`](src/BooksAPI.js) contains the methods we needed to perform necessary operations on the backend:


## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.
